###### The code in [filename] is for demonstrate the effect of CNN model.
## Usage
###### Need to download the code and CNN model in [filename], and put the code and CNN model in the same file.
### Step
1. Run the code with matlab.
1. Click the "選擇" bottom under the title "熱影像".
1. Select the Thermal Image want to upload.
1. Click the "選擇" bottom under the title "實際圖". (4. & 5. can be skip if don't have Real Image)
1. Select the Real Image want to upload.
1. Click the "執行" bottom to start the detection System.
1. The result will show on the screen as soon as it finish.
1. Click the "實際圖儲存" bottom or "熱影像儲存" bottom if you want to save the result.
